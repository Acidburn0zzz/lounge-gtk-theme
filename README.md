## IMPORTANT NOTE
For best experience, use Lounge theme with [Lounge-aux](https://github.com/monday15/lounge-aux) icons, it is a set of symbolic icons (window controls and arrows), other icons will be taken from default icon theme or one that you using. Installation is simple, proceed to [Lounge-aux repository](https://github.com/monday15/lounge-aux).

> Fedora users will get Lounge-aux as a weak dependency with Adwaita as a main icon theme, for other icon themes, they should also check the link. 

## Installation
> Lounge theme supports gnome 3.28+ (gtk3 3.22+).  
  Lounge-night theme requires `gtk-murrine-engine` (`gtk2-engines-murrine` for debian/ubuntu)

Download already built theme for your gnome version from [releases page](https://github.com/monday15/lounge-gtk-theme/releases), extract `Lounge` and `Lounge-night` folders to `/usr/share/themes` or `~/.themes`.

Fedora users can install theme via copr:  
`sudo dnf copr enable monday15/lounge`  
`sudo dnf install lounge-gtk-theme`


## Building from source
Youâ€™ll need `meson` and `sassc` packages.

Download source, run from source dir:  
`meson build`  
`sudo ninja -C build install`


## Extra
Firefox looks ok with the theme, but there are some tweaks, you can find them in `firefox-tweak` folder (or `firefox-tweak-dark` for dark theme). Copy `userChrome.css` to your profile's `chrome` dir - the path looks like this `~/.mozilla/firefox/randomletters.default/chrome/userChrome.css`.

## Removing
Remove installation folders `/usr/share/themes/Lounge`, `/usr/share/themes/Lounge-night`.
